Hi, welcome to the homepage of Yuan Lu, Ph.D. (simplified Chinese 路远 or traditional Chinese 路遠, which literally means *a long way to go*). My research spans blockchain infrastructure, decentralized applications, and the design and analysis of multi-party cryptographic protocols for Web3. I am particularly interested in developing efficient and secure foundations for trustworthy networked systems, with a focus on robustness, privacy protection, and resilience against censorship. My goal is to support citizen-first decentralized infrastructure and user-centric Web3 applications that can operate reliably in adversarial and unstable real-world environments. Representative research topics include:

- **Blockchain Consensus**. Enhancing the scalability and performance of asynchronous Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus to secure Layer-1 blockchain infrastructure deployed over the unstable real-world Internet (CCS 25/22a/22b, NDSS 25/22, USENIX Security 26, PODC 20, TDSC 25a, TIFS 25a).

- **Secure Multi-Party Computation**. Integrating fault-tolerant techniques into scalable MPC and federated learning systems, enabling robust deployments over the open and fluctuating Internet (USENIX Security 25a/25b).

- **Threshold Cryptographic Protocols**. Enhancing the efficiency of bootstrapping and reconfiguration, and also expanding the practical applications of modern threshold-cryptosystem-based fault-tolerant systems (SP 26, ICDCS 22, TDSC 25b, TIFS 25b).

- **Decentralized Applications**. Designing practical, privacy-preserving, and fair decentralized applications for peer-to-peer settings, ranging from decentralized data–cryptocurrency exchange to direct fiat–crypto swaps (ICDCS 20/18, TPDS 22, ESORICS 21, CVC 25 with Best Paper Award).

More Personal Trajectory
======
Borned in [Pingdingshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingdingshan) and raised in [Xiangyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangyang), I started my higher educations in the beautiful city of [Tianjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin), where I received my B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and B.B.A. degree in business administration from [Nankai University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nankai_University) and [Tianjin University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin_University) respectively in 2011. After another 3 years' hard work, I obtained my M.Eng. degree with highest honors in electrical engineering from Nankai University in 2014.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
