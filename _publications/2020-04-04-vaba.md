excerpt: 'We design and implement the first private and anonymous decentralized crowdsourcing system ZebraLancer, and overcome two fundamental challenges of decentralizing crowdsourcing, i.e. data leakage and identity breach. First, our outsource-then-prove methodology resolves the tension between blockchain transparency and data confidentiality, which is critical in crowdsourcing use-case. ZebraLancer ensures: (i) a requester will not pay more than what data deserve, according to a policy announced when her task is published via the blockchain; (ii) each worker indeed gets a payment based on the policy, if he submits data to the blockchain; (iii) the above properties are realized not only without a central arbiter, but also without leaking the data to the open blockchain. Furthermore, the transparency of blockchain allows one to infer private information about workers and requesters through their participation history. On the other hand, allowing anonymity will enable a malicious worker to submit multiple times to reap rewards. ZebraLancer overcomes this problem by allowing anonymous requests/submissions without sacrificing the accountability. The idea behind is a subtle linkability: if a worker submits twice to a task, anyone can link the submissions, or else he stays anonymous and unlinkable across tasks. To realize this delicate linkability, we put forward a novel cryptographic concept, i.e. the common-prefix-linkable anonymous authentication. We remark the new anonymous authentication scheme might be of independent interest. Finally, we implement our protocol for a common image annotation task and deploy it in a test net of Ethereum. The experiment results show the applicability of our protocol with the existing real-world blockchain.'

Multi-valued validated asynchronous Byzantine agreement (VABA\mathsf{VABA}VABA), proposed in the seminal work of Cachin et al. (CRYPTO'01), is fundamental for critical fault-tolerant services such as atomic broadcast in the asynchronous network. It was left as an open problem to reduce the O(ℓn2+λn2+n3)\mathcal{O}(\ell n^2+\lambda n^2+n^3)O(ℓn2+λn2+n3) communication asymptotically (where nnn is the number of parties, ℓ\ellℓ is the input size, λ\lambdaλ is the security parameter). In a recent breakthrough, Abraham et al. (PODC'19) removed the n3n^3n3 term to partially answer the question when the input size is small. However, in many other use cases, e.g., the application from Cachin et al. to atomic broadcast, the input size ℓ≥λn\ell \geq \lambda nℓ≥λn, thus the total communication is dominated by the O(ℓn2)\mathcal{O}(\ell n^2)O(ℓn2) term, and the problem raised by Cachin et al. remains open. We fill the gap and answer the remaining part of the open problem. In particular, we design and analyze two VABA\mathsf{VABA}VABA protocols with O(ℓn+λn2)\mathcal{O}(\ell n+\lambda n^2)O(ℓn+λn2) communication, which is optimal when ℓ≥λn\ell\geq\lambda nℓ≥λn. We also maintain all other benefits including optimal resilience to tolerate up to n/3n/3n/3 Byzantine corruptions, optimal expected constant running time, and optimal O(n2)\mathcal{O}(n^2)O(n2) message complexity. At the core of our design, we propose asynchronous provable dispersal broadcast (APDB\mathsf{APDB}APDB) so that an input value can be split and dispersed to each party and later recovered. Compared to a related notion of asynchronous verifiable information dispersal, an important feature of APDB\mathsf{APDB}APDB is weakening the {\em agreement} to enable a more efficient construction while still ensuring the dispersed value can be consistently recovered later. Using the new method, we design and analyze an optimal VABA\mathsf{VABA}VABA protocol. We also present a general self-bootstrap technique to reduce the communication of any existing VABA\mathsf{VABA}VABA (for large input). After applying our APDB\mathsf{APDB}APDB protocol, the self-bootstrap framework uses small inputs to invoke VABA\mathsf{VABA}VABA to pick the dispersed value to recast, and thus improves the underlying VABA\mathsf{VABA}VABA.
